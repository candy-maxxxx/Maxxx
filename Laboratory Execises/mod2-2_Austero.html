		<h1>Grave of the Fireflies</h1>
		<p>To be honest I don't really watch anime. But one it was during our English 2 class when Nay Bev let us watch a movie Grave of the Fireflies because our lesson is under japenese literature. The movie is a story about two kids in Japan having to suffer after their mother died in a firebombing of World War II. “It tells a simple story of survival,” displaying the harshness of war from kids' point of view. It is an anti-war movie.</p>
